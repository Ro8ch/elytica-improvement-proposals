# elytica Improvement Proposals

1. Add an upload button to the "Show project input files" popup. It can move the file to the bottom as soon as the file is done downloading and grey out the upload button to indicate the uploads have completed.

2. Create an upload box for data files at the start where you are creating a new project so that the files are already available when you start with the model.

3. When debugging the interpreter runs through all the code and then generates an entire list of errors instead of just one to fix. If it can do most important or first error only it will make the focus when debugging better.

4. When debugging it's possible to read when the line is with the error but is usually involves scrolling and careful reading before you can start thinking about the actual bug. Adding a red line at the line where the error is found will  pull your eyes to it and allow you to debug a lot faster. Auto moving the cursor to the spesific part of the line where the error is will also be very helpful.

5. It's difficult to find documentation on certain things you're able to or not able to do within elytica. If there could be a button at the top within each project and on top on the list of projects that redirects to the github documentation or a page that has some documentation that will be very helpful.
